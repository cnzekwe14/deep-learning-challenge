The purpose of the analysis is to determine which applicants should receive funding based on the chance of having a successful venture.  The model would assist in perdicting in how to allocate the fund to provide applicants with enhancing their venture successes.

The IS_SUCCESSFUL column was the target variable used for the model.  For the features there were two different types used.  For the first model which outputed 73% all columns were used except for EIN, NAME and IS_SUCCESSFUL.  The second model which outputed 96%, all columns were used for the feature except IS_SUCCESSFUL.  EIN and NAME are the variables that can be removed because they are neither targets or features.
